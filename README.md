**`Quiz-app`**

This fun quiz-app is built with React, React Router, and styled component. CSS animations are also used in it.

`3 main screen layouts`

	* An introduction screen that introduces the user to the quiz, this screen should also have start button
	
	  and an image.

	* A main question layout screen, this screen will display each question, one at a time.

	* A quiz conclusion screen that contains:

		* the user’s percentage score;

		* a transcript that shows which answers the user got correct/incorrect;

		* If the user has failed the quiz, don’t show the transcript but instead 
		
		  a fail message accompanied by a Retry button which starts the quiz over again.
